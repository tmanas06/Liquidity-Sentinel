# Blockscout Analysis

AI agent skill for blockchain data analysis and building tools that query on-chain data through the Blockscout MCP Server. Works across all EVM chains indexed by Blockscout.

## What this skill does

The skill gives an agent domain expertise in two areas:

1. **Blockchain activity analysis** — answering questions about wallets, tokens, transactions, contracts, and NFTs using the Blockscout MCP Server.
2. **Building scripts and tools** — writing and executing code that queries blockchain data via the MCP REST API for deterministic, multi-step flows.

## Key ideas

- **Single data source**: All data access goes through the Blockscout MCP Server (native MCP tools or REST API). Chainscout is used only to resolve chain IDs to Blockscout explorer URLs.
- **Data source priority**: Dedicated MCP tools first (enriched, LLM-friendly), then `direct_api_call` for endpoints not covered by dedicated tools.
- **Execution strategy**: The skill guides the agent to choose between direct tool calls, scripts (REST API), hybrid approaches, and LLM reasoning — based on task complexity and whether deterministic logic or semantic understanding is needed.
- **Multichain**: Almost all MCP tools accept a `chain_id` parameter. The agent uses `get_chains_list` to discover supported chains.

- **`SKILL.md`** is the self-contained agent entry point. An agent that reads only this file has everything it needs to behave correctly.
- **`references/`** contains API endpoint details the agent looks up during execution (e.g., to find parameters for `direct_api_call`).

## Setup

Integration depends on your agent platform. For optimal results, configure the Blockscout MCP server (`https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp`) in your agent's MCP settings. The skill can fall back to the REST API if native MCP is not available.
